BigDSP is a framework for writing your very own audio processing/visualization componenents. Mostly an exploration of the browser-based Web Audio API. The work in progress WebAudio standard promises to be a powerful resource in client side audio processing and synthesizing.

**Bundled Plugins**
BigDSP contains seven plugins by default, each demonstrating some core features the Web Audio framework provides. [Located in plugins/]

The project currently lacks good documentation so these can serve as a springboard for your own projects.
